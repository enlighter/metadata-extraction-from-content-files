<p class="calibre9">‘Guha is a scholar of astounding energy and ingenuity, and his book triumphantly dismisses an often-made plea: that India’s contemporary history cannot be written because (as a result of government pigheadedness) the sources are not available. He seems to have visited every archive from Alabama to Allahabad, Calcutta to California, delving into a sea of private correspondence, news reports, pamphlet ephemera, as well as state papers. The result is a fascinating, kaleidoscopic narrative’</p>

<p class="calibre22"/>
<p class="calibre9">‘Superb, gloriously detailed . . . a brilliant and beautifully balanced book. It is impeccably researched and documented, but Guha is no dry-as-dust academic historian. He presents his facts objectively but never hides his patriotism or cosmopolitan, Nehruvian ethos. He avoids self congratulation and celebrates the survival of democratic India without overlooking the nation’s countless failings and shortcomings’</p>

<p class="calibre9"> ‘No brief review could convey the astonishing range of this remarkable and capacious book . . . Guha marshals his facts and figures brilliantly . . . There will undoubtedly be other books covering the extraordinary and exhilarating story of post-independence India, but it is hard to imagine there will be a better one’</p>

<p class="calibre9">‘It’s not often that you want a 771 page book to be longer. But as you race – yes, race – through <span class="italic1">India After Gandhi</span> . . . you keep feeling that way. Guha writes lucidly,with unobtrusively readable prose, covers most bases, paints characters in with apposite quote or wry comment, points to broad themes, but also picks fascinating small details and in general keeps things going at an excellent pace’</p>
