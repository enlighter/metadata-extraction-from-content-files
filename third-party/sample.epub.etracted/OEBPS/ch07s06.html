We've looked closely at the Cycle plugin, jQuery UI, and jQuery Mobile, and in the process have learned the patterns that we will encounter time and again in other plugins. In the next chapter, we'll take advantage of jQuery's plugin architecture to develop a few different types of plugins of our own.</p></div></body></html>
