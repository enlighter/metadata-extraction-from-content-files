By the time he first publicly announced his project in January 2006, he had added DOM modification and basic animations. He gave it the name jQuery to emphasize the central role of finding or querying parts of a web page and acting on them with JavaScript. Rapidly over the years since then, jQuery has grown in its feature set, improved in its performance, and gained widespread adoption by many of the most popular sites on the Internet. While Resig has since stepped down from his role as lead developer of the project, jQuery has blossomed, in true open source fashion, to the point where it now boasts a top-notch core team headed by Dave Methvin, as well as a vibrant community of thousands of additional JavaScript developers.</p><p>The jQuery JavaScript library can enhance your websites regardless of your background. It provides a wide range of features, an easy-to-learn syntax, and robust cross-platform compatibility in a single compact file. What's more, hundreds of plugins have been developed to extend jQuery's functionality, making it an essential tool for nearly every client-side scripting occasion.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Learning jQuery Fourth Edition</em></span> provides a gentle introduction to jQuery concepts, allowing you to add interactions and animations to your pages&#x2014;even if previous attempts at writing JavaScript have left you baffled. This book guides you past the pitfalls associated with Ajax, events, effects, and advanced JavaScript language features, and provides you with a brief reference to the jQuery library to return to again and again.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter&#xA0;1.&#xA0;Getting Started">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started</em></span>, will get your feet wet with the jQuery JavaScript library. The chapter begins with a description of jQuery and what it can do for you. It then walks you through downloading and setting up the library, as well as writing your first script.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter&#xA0;2.&#xA0;Selecting Elements">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Selecting Elements</em></span>, will teach how to use jQuery's selector expressions and DOM traversal methods to find elements on the page, wherever they may be. You'll use jQuery to apply styling to a diverse set of page elements, sometimes in a way that pure CSS cannot.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter&#xA0;3.&#xA0;Handling Events">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Handling Events</em></span>, will walk you through jQuery's event-handling mechanism to fire off behaviors when browser events occur. You'll see how jQuery makes it easy to attach events to elements unobtrusively, even before the page finishes loading. Also, you'll get an overview of deeper topics, such as event bubbling, delegation, and namespacing.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter&#xA0;4.&#xA0;Styling and Animating">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Styling and Animating</em></span>, will introduce you to jQuery's animation techniques and how to hide, show, and move page elements with effects that are both useful and pleasing to the eye.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter&#xA0;5.&#xA0;Manipulating the DOM">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Manipulating the DOM</em></span>, will teach you how to change your page on command.

<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter&#xA0;8.&#xA0;Developing Plugins">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Developing Plugins</em></span>, will teach you how to take advantage of jQuery's impressive extension capabilities to develop your own plugins from the ground up. You'll create your own utility functions, add jQuery object methods, and discover the jQuery UI widget factory. Next, you'll take a second tour through jQuery's building blocks, learning more advanced techniques.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter&#xA0;9.&#xA0;Advanced Selectors and Traversing">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Selectors and Traversing</em></span>, will refine your knowledge of selectors and traversals, gaining the ability to optimize selectors for performance, manipulate the DOM element stack, and write plugins that expand selecting and traversing capabilities.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter&#xA0;10.&#xA0;Advanced Events">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Events</em></span>, will dive further into techniques such as delegation and throttling that can greatly improve event-handling performance.
