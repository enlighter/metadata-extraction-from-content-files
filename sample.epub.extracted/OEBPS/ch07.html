Doing this has illustrated many of the ways in which the jQuery library can be used to accomplish a wide variety of tasks. Yet as powerful as the library is at its core, its elegant <span class="strong"><strong>plugin architecture</strong></span> has allowed developers to extend jQuery, making it even more feature-rich.</p><p>The growing jQuery community has created hundreds of plugins&#x2014;from small selector helpers to full-scale user-interface widgets. We will now learn how to tap into this vast resource.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Downloading and setting up plugins</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Calling jQuery methods provided by plugins</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Finding elements using custom selectors defined by jQuery plugins</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Adding sophisticated user interface behaviors using jQuery UI</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Implementing mobile-friendly features using jQuery Mobile</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Finding plugins and help"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec56"/>Finding plugins and help</h1></div></div></div><p>The jQuery website provides a large <a id="id534" class="indexterm"/>repository of plugins at <a class="ulink" href="http://plugins.jquery.com/">http://plugins.jquery.com/</a>. Many of the plugins listed in this Plugin Registry have links to demos, example code, and tutorials to help us get started. The plugins referenced from this registry are all managed in the GitHub (<a class="ulink" href="http://github.com/">http://github.com/</a>) code repository. Because <a id="id535" class="indexterm"/>GitHub tracks how many developers have "starred" and forked a repository, we can get a sense of a plugin's quality, or at least popularity, as this information is conveniently presented in the sidebar of the plugin's page on the Plugin Registry.</p><p>If we can't find the answers to all of our questions in the Plugin Registry, GitHub, the author's website, or the plugin's comments, we can always turn to the jQuery community for assistance. The jQuery forums include a dedicated area for discussion on using plugins at <a class="ulink" href="http://forum.jquery.com/using-jquery-plugins">http://forum.jquery.com/using-jquery-plugins</a>. Many of the plugin authors are frequent contributors to the <a id="id536" class="indexterm"/>forums and are eager to help with any problems that new users might face.</p></div></div></body></html>
